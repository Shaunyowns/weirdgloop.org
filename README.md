# weirdgloop.org

This repository contains the source code that is used to build the Weird Gloop [website](http://weirdgloop.org). The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which means that editing and creating pages on the site is as simple as changing Markdown files. The configuration for the site is stored in `_config.yml`.

Commits pushed to the `master` branch get built using GitLab CI and then deployed to GitLab Pages, available at https://weirdgloop.org.
